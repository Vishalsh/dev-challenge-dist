            <strong>Anything you had to change or assume about this task to make your solution</strong>
            <p>
                Since the web socket is returning only a single currency pair data each time,
                I am assuming if a pair is not present, create a new one, otherwise update the existing pair.
                The table is sorted on the basis of how much the lastChangeBid has changed, no matter if it has
                decreased or increased.

            <strong>A high level description of your approach</strong>
            <p>
                I have tried to follow the component based architecture approach using vanilla js.
                The solution consist of Forex class which uses the CurrencyPair class for each row.
                The Forex returns the new string template to be drawn as html each time the data is updated.

            <strong>If you added any other development-time steps, what they are, why you added them and how to run
                them</strong>
            <p>
                I have used jest as a testing framework. please run <strong>npm test</strong> to run
                the tests. It will also show the test coverage.

            <strong>Which libraries/fralivemeworks you would have liked to have used (if any), and how they would have
                made
                the result better</strong>
            <p>
                I would have liked to use react to solve this problem. The reason behind is the performance as it relies
                on virtual
                dom to update the dom and takes care about the which part is needed to be updated and just change that
                only.
                Since in this problem, we need to update the dom every second to update the data, react would have been
                a useful library.
                Also, the component based architecture also would have worked well creating different components for
                table, table-row and each sprkline.
